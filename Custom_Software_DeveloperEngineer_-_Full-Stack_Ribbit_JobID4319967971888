\textbf{Full Stack Developer -- KILATECH (Pvt) Ltd}, \textbf{Sri Lanka} \hfill Apr 2020 -- Dec 2022

\vspace{-1pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed secure React dashboards featuring real-time telemetry, aircraft tracking, video feeds, and alert systems integration.
\item Built resilient backend services in Node.js and Python for mission control, including telemetry routing and status processing.
\item Integrated WebSocket and REST APIs to synchronize control interfaces under unreliable connections and degraded link states.
\item Designed and enforced RBAC, JWT-based auth, SSO, and MFA support to ensure secure mission-critical access permissions.
\item Deployed services using Docker and AWS ECS with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, improving release fidelity and system uptime.
\item Collaborated with flight-test teams in field trials, collecting operational data to iterate on UI functionality and backend logic.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Frontend Developer -- FMI (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka} \hfill Apr 2019 -- Dec 2019

\vspace{-1pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item Built modular frontends using React and TypeScript to visualize drone telemetry, mission states, and geospatial overlays.
\item Worked with API teams to consume and debug flight data endpoints using REST and GraphQL under tight network conditions.
\item Designed interfaces for low-bandwidth environments, optimizing load time and reliability for critical operations software.
\item Wrote Cypress and Jest test suites and integrated them into CI pipelines to automate regression checks across code updates.
\item Participated in sprint planning and user story grooming to align frontend implementation with team goals and field realities.

\textbf{Autonomous Aircraft Ops Dashboard}

\vspace{-1pt}

Web control interface enabling real-time monitoring, mission planning, and telemetry display for drone fleets.
\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed frontend with React and Leaflet.js for live geospatial tracking of aircraft and streaming telemetry integration.
\item Established WebSocket channels for data updates with fallback options, supporting stable mission ops under poor links.
\item Implemented protected routes, SSO authentication, RBAC roles, and audit logs to harden UI against unauthorized access.
\item Tested data visualizations in SITL/HIL environments with cross-team input; iterated UI via hands-on field trial feedback.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secure Telemetry and Command Gateway}

\vspace{-1pt}

Microservice API managing command relays, telemetry flows, and access roles across distributed drone systems.
\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created Node.js-based gateway to receive, route, and process telemetry over resilient WebSocket links with retry logic.
\item Enabled role-based access control and token security with JWT, SSO hooks, and endpoint-level rate limiting enforcement.
\item Deployed to AWS ECS via Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines with auto-monitoring for connection health metrics.
\item Built logging with Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards for real-time alerting and traceable ops transparency.
\end{itemize}
