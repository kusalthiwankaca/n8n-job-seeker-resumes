\textbf{IoT Event Monitoring Platform}

\vspace{-1pt}

Built a secure cloud dashboard with role-based access control to monitor real-time events from MQTT/IoT sensors.
\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed front-end dashboards in React with WebSocket support for real-time data streaming from distributed devices.
\item Integrated backend logic using Node.js services that authenticated users and parsed inbound MQTT device signals.
\item Implemented time-series DB storage using TimescaleDB to archive device events with retrieval logic for filters \& charts.
\item Tested deployments via Docker and CI pipeline workflows using GitHub Actions before provisioning to AWS ECS with Nginx.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cloud Functions API Gateway}

\vspace{-1pt}

Implemented serverless backend microservices architecture to handle secure API routing and external webhooks.
\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Used AWS Lambda with API Gateway to expose modular REST endpoints that handled webhook validation and processing.
\item Added integration to MongoDB and Redis stores and decoupled queues with batch processing using AWS SQS pipelines.
\item Automated secret rotation and IAM policies using Terraform, ensuring zero-touch infrastructure trust and access flows.
\item Wrote Jest test coverage with mocked network handlers and deployed both staging/prod via CI/CD with Bitbucket Pipelines.
